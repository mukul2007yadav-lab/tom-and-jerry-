    <h1>Under SC orders, green crackers return to Delhi – can this really clear the air? Here is what experts say</h1>
    <h1> </h1>
    <h3>Days ahead of Diwali, there is apprehension and scepticism: ‘No way to establish that a cracker is really ‘green’; supply-chain not foolproof, QR codes and stickers don’t help; policies piecemeal and directionless’</h3>

     <h4>Children burning crackers on the occasion of diwali.</h4>
     <h3>As Delhi readies for Diwali, the Supreme Court’s decision on Wednesday (October 15) to allow ‘green’ crackers on a “test basis” has once again sparked the decade-long debate over balancing festive tradition, public health concerns, and livelihood.</h3>

<h3>Welcoming the order, Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said it was a “balanced decision” that recognised both cultural sentiment and environmental responsibility, and added that the government would ensure the court’s directions are “followed word by word and line by line”.</h3>

<h3>He also said that officials would meet retailers and enforcement departments later in the day to chalk out a compliance plan.</h3>
<h3>Following the Supreme Court’s order, The Indian Express spoke to experts and scientists to understand the impact of the relaxation</h3>
<h3>Dr Manoj Kumar, air quality analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said the timing of Diwali (October 20) this year may slightly reduce the overlap with stubble-burning, but warned that the pollution impact could still be significant.
